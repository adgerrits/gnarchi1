    documentation="A communication network represents a set of structures that connects computer systems or other electronic devices for transmission, routing, and reception of data or data-based communications such as voice and video.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A communication network represents the physical communication infrastructure. It represents ”a set of products, concepts, and services that enable the connection of computer systems or devices for the purpose of transmitting data and other forms (e.g., voice and video) between the systems”, as defined by the TOGAF framework [4].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A communication network connects two or more devices. The most basic communication network is a single link between two devices, but it may comprise multiple links and associated network equipment. A network has properties such as bandwidth and latency. A communication network realizes one or more paths. It embodies the physical realization of the logical path between nodes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A communication network can consist of sub-networks. It can aggregate devices and system software, for example, to model the routers, switches, and firewalls that are part of the network infrastructure."/>
