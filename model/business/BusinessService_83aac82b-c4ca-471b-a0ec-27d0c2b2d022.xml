    documentation="A business service represents an explicitly defined exposed business behavior.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A business service exposes the functionality of business roles or collaborations to their environment. This functionality is accessed through one or more business interfaces.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A business service should provide a unit of behavior that is meaningful from the point of view of the environment. It has a purpose, which states this utility. The environment includes the (behavior of) users from outside as well as inside the organization. Business services can be external, customer-facing services (e.g., a travel insurance service) or internal support services (e.g., a resource management service).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A business service is associated with a value. A business service may serve a business process, business function, or business interaction. A business process, business function, or business interaction may realize a business service. A business interface may be assigned to a business service. A business service may access business objects. The name of a business service should preferably be a verb ending with “ing”; e.g., transaction processing. Also, a name explicitly containing the word “service” may be used."/>
