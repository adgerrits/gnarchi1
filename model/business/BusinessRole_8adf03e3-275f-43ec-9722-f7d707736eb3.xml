    documentation="A business role is the responsibility for performing specific behavior, to which an actor can be assigned, or the part an actor plays in a particular action or event.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Business roles with certain responsibilities or skills are assigned to business processes or business functions. A business actor that is assigned to a business role is responsible that the corresponding behavior is carried out, either by performing it or by delegating and managing its performance. In addition to the relation of a business role with behavior, a business role is also useful in a (structural) organizational sense; for instance, in the division of labor within an organization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A business role may be assigned to one or more business processes or business functions, while a business actor may be assigned to one or more business roles. A business interface or an application interface may serve a business role, while a business interface may be part of a business role. The name of a business role should preferably be a noun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;ArchiMate modelers may represent generic organizational entities that perform behavior as either business actors or business roles. For example, the business actor Supplier depicts an organizational entity, while the business role Supplier depicts a responsibility. Specific or generic business actors can be assigned to carry responsibilities depicted as business roles. For example, the specific business actor ABC Corporation or the generic business actor Business Partner can be assigned to the Supplier business role."/>
